    "### Pi Approximation\n",
    "Consider a unit circle inscribed inside of a square. If we randomly throw darts at the square, some of the darts will land inside the circle and others will land outside the circle but within the square. The probability that a dart lands inside of the circle equals the area of the circle divided by the area of the square. We can use a simulation of the dart throws to approximate the value of $\\pi$.\n",
