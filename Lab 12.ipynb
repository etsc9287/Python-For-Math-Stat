    "### Missing Values\n",
    "Begin by calling `dfmajors.info()`. Note that there are missing values (`Nan`s) in the `Men` and `Women` columns. Use the `dropna()` method to remove all rows with missing values. (The method `dropna()` makes a copy so you will need to assign the result to `dfmajors`.) Check to see that the missing values have been removed.\n",

    "### Summary of Statistics\n",
    "Call `dfmajors.describe()` to see a summary of the numerical data in `dfmajors`. \n",

    "* How many majors with a `Total` of 150,000 or higher have a median income of at least \\$45,000?\n",
    "* Make a scatter plot with `Total` along the $x$-axis and `Median` along the $y$-axis. Is there a relationship?\n",
    "* Make a box plot of median incomes. What does the plot show?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Percentage Women\n",
    "* Add a column to your dataframe called `Pct_women` that contains the percentage women in each major.\n",
    "* Which 10 majors have the highest percentage of women?\n",
    "* Which 10 majors have the lowest percentage of women?\n",
